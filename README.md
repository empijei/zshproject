# zshproject
A collection of sourcefiles for zsh

# Example usage:
Fork this project on your github or wherever you want, then put this in your .zshrc:
```sh
source ~/your-fork/zshproject/sourcer.sourceme
```

Then, when you need to add something to your .zshrc, just use the command `zshconfig` that will create a file that will not conflict with other hostnames so you can keep your zshrc in sync across computers

Depends on autojump and zsh-syntax-highlight
